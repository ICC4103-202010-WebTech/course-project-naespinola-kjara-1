We used Factory Bot and FFaker to create data automatically, but we were never able to prove that this actually worked, because it threw us the error "NoMethodError: undefined method` create_list 'for main: Object "when we used the rake db: populate_fake_data command. But you can see the file test/factories.rb and lib/tasks/model_queries.rake that contains what we did about this.`
